the provided libuvc.so is compiled for AArch64. It is a custom version of libuvc that supports Y16 video format. If you're using different architecture, you will need to build the library from source:

git clone https://github.com/groupgets/libuvc

cd libuvc

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

cp libuvc.so ~/ai-thermometer/ir/libuvc_wrapper
